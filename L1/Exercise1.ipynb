    "\n",
    "**Beer gardens are packed**, the Isar river becomes the city's beach, and suddenly everyone acts like winter never happened.  \n",

    "How much beer does a Bavarian family consume on an average evening? Let's calculate!  \n",

    "\n",
    "$$ B = P \\times M \\times S $$\n",

    "- **\\( B \\)** = Total beer consumed in liters  \n",

    "- **\\( M \\)** = Average beer consumption per person (in Maß)  \n",
    "- **\\( S \\)** = Socializing factor (the later the night, the higher)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume a Bavarian family of **4 people** sits together. Each person drinks an average of **2 Maß** (2 liters). Since the night is long, we set the socializing factor to **1.2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B = 4 \\times 2 \\times 1.2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total consumption: 14.4 liters of beer!** 🍻\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaways:**  \n",
    "- An average Bavarian evening produces enough beer consumption to supply half a beer garden.  \n",
    "- The socializing factor increases exponentially with **Bavarian brass band music**.  \n",
